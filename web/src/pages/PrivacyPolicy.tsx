        Welcome to our site! We’re here to make money by selling your data,
        plain and simple. Read on to see how we turn your information into cash.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mb-3 mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold">
        Information We Collect
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-3">
        We collect the following info because data is money:
      </p>

      <ul className="mb-4 list-disc pl-5">
        <li>Your name and contact info (we need to know who we’re selling)</li>
        <li>Demographic information (the more we know, the more we make)</li>
        <li>Any other info you give us (we’re not picky, we’ll take it all)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="mb-3 mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold">
        How We Use the Information
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-3">Here’s how we turn your info into cash:</p>

      <ul className="mb-4 list-disc pl-5">
        <li>Internal record keeping (so we know who to sell next)</li>
        <li>Improving our products and services (to get more of your money)</li>
        <li>Sending promotional emails (to tempt you into spending more)</li>
        <li>
          Occasionally contacting you for market research (aka, figuring out how
          to get even more cash from you)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="mb-3 mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold">Security</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We secure your data just enough to keep it valuable. We have physical,
        electronic, and managerial procedures in place, but let’s be real – if
        someone wants your data, they’ll find a way.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mb-3 mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold">Cookies</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Cookies are tiny bits of data we plant on your device to track what you
        like. The more we know, the better we can target you with ads, and the
        more money we make. Agreeing to cookies means agreeing to be tracked for
        our profit.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mb-3 mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold">
        Links to Other Websites
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Our site might link to other websites. Once you leave our site, you’re
        on your own. We can’t protect your data there, but those sites probably
        want your data too. It’s a data-selling free-for-all!
      </p>

      <h2 className="mb-3 mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold">
        Controlling Your Personal Information
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Want to limit how we use your info? Here’s how you can try:
      </p>

      <ul className="mb-4 list-disc pl-5">
        <li>
          If you agreed to let us use your info for marketing, you can change
          your mind anytime by emailing us at [yashpalsinght9@gmail.com]. We
          might stop selling your data. Maybe.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you think any info we have is wrong or incomplete, email us. We’ll
          fix it (after we stop laughing and counting our money).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4">
        This privacy policy is subject to change without notice. We might find
        new ways to make money off your data, so check back often.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is simple: to make as much money as possible by selling your
        data to whoever will pay us. Thanks for your contribution to our bank
        account!
